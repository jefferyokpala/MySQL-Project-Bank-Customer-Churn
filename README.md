## Tools

## Process

### Initial data exploration and preprocessing

* I downloaded the CSV file of this dataset and opened it on Microsoft Excel to get a feel for it and understand the kind of information it contains. I believe this step is important because it helps me know what to look for and what to expect when I start exploratory data analysis. The dataset contained 18 columns and 10,000 rows.

* Upon my initial exploration of the dataset, I noticed the data was not that dirty, but some values needed to be standardized to make the information more easily understood by anyone who looks at it. I closed MS Excel and opened MySQL Workbench and created a database to house the dataset. Next, I created a table called "churn" with each column having the data type most appropriate for the values in the column.
